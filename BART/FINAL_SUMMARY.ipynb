This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license. The authors discuss ways for increasing the HER eﬃciency of 2D catalysts for hydrogen production. They also discuss the future prospects for 2D nanocomposites in HER electrocatalysts.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 1: Hydrogen is regarded as an energy transporter and beneﬁcial energy storage. Water is the primary natural source of hydrogen. Renewable or non-renewable sources  best produce hydrogen. Both combustion engines and fuel cells consume hydrogen a lot. H2 can be identified as an epitome  and clean energy transporter. It is critical to access cost-eﬀective  and energy-e-scientific-e.nish the chemicals. As a result, it is not possible to end up with hydrogen as a constituent of substances.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 2: Hydrogen is a green energy source that is renewable, sustainable, and clean. The only choice is splitting water for H2generation. Hydrogen may be produced in a variety of ways. The proportion of hydrogen produced from various sources is around 48 percent from natural gas, 30 percent from oils, 18 percent from coal, and barely  4% from water electrolysis. The creation and immobilization of H2 constitute the detachment and immobilizing of H 2 in alkaline media. The reaction in acid, and the reaction in medium, and sequestration of the H2 is the Hydrogen evolution.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 3: The energy performance of electrochemical water splitting is improved by the development of eﬃcient  and cost-eﬀective  elec-trocatalysts. The intrinsic activity of catalysts is signiﬁcant, and on another hand, the construction of catalytic materials is grave to obtaining impressive catalytic procedures. Pt-based materials perform well in broad tests, but their scarcity and enormous cost limit their usage on a broad scale.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 4: Researchers are concentrating on modifying  extremely active catalysts that are earth-abundant, rough, and can replace expensive metal catalysts. The advance of 2D electrocatalysts is subjected to the exploration of new 2D nanomaterials. The porous TM boride-Based is one of the emerging  cost-eﬀective  and  high-performance  electrocatalyst for replacing precious Pt-based materials. And we discuss strategies for enhancing the HER performance of these materials.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 5: 2D materials are used as electrocatalysts in the water electrolysis for the creation of hydrogen. They have an enormous surface area, plentiful edge states, and variable electronic parameters. The current expansion of 2D materials in electrocatalyst research for HER is highlighted in this review. The sections below will provide valuable information about Graphene-based materials, graphitic carbon nitride, and black  phosphorus2.1. Metal-free 2D Nanomaterials and TMDs.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 6: Graphene is the most fundamental building block for other dimensional carbon substances. It is characterized by an exclusive layered structure, unusual physical, chemical, and electronic features. It has a huge surface area and strong electrical conductivity. Theoreticalsurface  area (2630 m2g−1) and carrier mobility of 15,000 cm2V−1s−1 have made researchers mull over graphene. It can be used to modify moleculculum to modify Molecule of the Month (MOM)\n",
            "Summary for chunk 7: Graphene and g-C3N4 hybrid systems are a prospective electrocatalyst for HER. Black phosphorus (BP) is an extremely active and durable catalyst. BP nanosheets are promising electrocatalysts for HER, but their electrical stability and low electrocatalysis potential could be due to its weak electrical stability. BP has a potential of 0.35 Vvs. SHE, which is less than the basal-plane potential of SHE. It has a low overpotential of 125 mVat  10 mAcm−2 for HER in an acid condition.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 8: The edge-plane of BP’s likely catalytic activity is much more than that of other nonprecious  electrocatalysts. Phosphorene can be boosted by doping or combining it with other active compounds. BP(Mo), BP(Co), and BP(Ni),  modiﬁes  the HER electrocatalyst, according to Yu et al. [77]. With an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mAcm−2, BP( co) had the uppermost activity.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 9: Bulk TMDs have monolayers that van der Waals forces  stacked them. MX2TMDs can be recognized as octahedral (1T0), metallic (1 T), and semiconducting (2H) phases. The X sites at the layer margins have been used for electrocatalytic applications. MoS2 has drawn a lot of interest as an HER catalyst. The lessening of the thickness of 2D-TMD’s is usually subject to improved conductivity, strength, and strength.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 10: TMDs, particularly 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides(2D-TMD) have large surface areas, which allow for the creation of more exposed  catalytically active sites. They have an easy preparation method and can be done at a wide pH value for HER. TMDs are maintained as more doping option in comparison with graphene because both nonmetal atoms and metal atoms can be doped into TMD lattices. The low value and indirect indirect  bandgap contribute to measure  and calculate  the bandgap of TMDS.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 11: MoS2 has been used for electrochemical hydrogen production since the 1970s. MoS2 is coordinated by six chalcogenide atoms in the shape of an octahedron or triangular prism. The Mo in the 1T phase,  the only metallic  phase with high conductivity, is synchronized. The 3R phase is quite similar  to the 2H phase. The research indicated that there are deﬁciencies  in its activity. In case they are zig-zag,  they are metallic.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 12: MoS2/graphite                  nanoparticles were active toward the HER catalyst, with an overpotential  between 0.1 and 0.2 V. MoSe2 also has a high inherent electrical conductivity, even more than MoS2. MoTe2 has not yet drawn much interest from researchers. The present research paves a new direction in design of several amorphous transition metal chalcogenide nanocomposites as stable,  low-price,  and eﬃcient catalysts.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 13: been on using bulk MoTe2single crystals  or mechanically                  exfoliated  nanosheets in HER. The low active  sites and conductivity  of MoTe 2can be attributed  to the HER. Its activity  ofMoTe2is  still poor (10 >300 mv) [29,52,122–125]. The conductivity of semiconducting TMDs is not as good as that of metallic T MDs. WSe2, MoSe2,. MoS2(1−x)Se2x, WS2, VS2, VSe2. CoS2, WTe2, TaS2,. PdTe2,. and PtTeare among TMD materials that can be utilized as an active  electrocatalyst.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 14: The increased catalytic activity of electrocatalysts has been achieved by modifying the morphology and structure of the developed electrocatalyst. To increase  the catalytic  activity, 0D, 1D, and 2D materials are used. Heterostructures are a successful way to achieve  excellent  electroCatalytic performances since they are composed of 0D and 1D materials. We present a 0D/2D heterostructure based on MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2/RGO)\n",
            "Summary for chunk 15: S2/Mo2Cheterostructure had rough surfaces both at the micro-and nanoscale. It showed                  suitable  electrocatalytic activity (Fig.6). The enhanced interfacial  mass transfer and the surface  oxygen  created  on Mo2C were the reasons for the superior  performance of this MoS2-rGOheterostructure. 1D materials with good conductivities are detected as unlike 0D materials, and they are able to be used as catalytic  sites and also as conductive substrates.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 16: The CZTS/MoS2-rGO heterostructure  electrocatalyst (Fig.7) was synthesized by Renuka V. Digraskar et al. via a one-step sono-chemical method. When the CZ TS is paired with MoS2, the heterost structure has an exceptional HER performance with an onset potential as low as 50 mVvs. The Van Der Waals heterostructures are suitable to address the  issues related to the current of energy.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 17: The researchers could improve charge  transfer kinetics of 2D materials. They created a vdW(van  der Waals) heterostructure composed of graphene and nitrogen-doped MoS2. The G@N-MoS2catalyst provided optimal HER activities with a low over-reprehensible potential of 243 mV. The researchers also looked into HER performances in this study. They stated decent performances for HER, using it, could improve  charge transfer kinetics.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 18:  MXenes with higher catalytic  active sites and better electrical  conductivity are prospective substitutes for 2D non-metal alkenes. MXenes have a huge surface area and strong interfacial  contact. Their top electrical and metallic conductivities (6000 − 8000 Scm−1) are improved, as well as their huge surface  area. The distinct catalytic properties of MXenes include outstanding ﬂexibility,  good hydrophilicity, 2D morphology, and laminar structures.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 19:  MX, RG, and MX@RG  composite  electrocatalysts have been developed. The MX@ RG composite materials had higher HER activity. Merging the other transition metals with MXenes can be used as perfect substrates. Heterostructures will be a sage and likely planned  movement  in multi- component  catalyst systems. They can produce a sturdy  MXene-based  hybrid  [52]. They can also be used to create  a  nano-catalyst system.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 20: Strain engineering, defect engineering,  defect  formation,  heteroatom doping,  ion intercalation, and interfacial interaction can enhance the catalytic activity of 2D nanomaterial-based catalysts. The absorption of hydrogen results from the g-C3N4and the electron transfer ability of N-doped graphene is increased by the graphene network. For HER kinetics, Qiao et al. coupled g-N4with N-Doped graphene (g−C3n4@NG) serve as a heterostructured catalyst.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 21: Diss dispersing atoms of metal on the 2D substrates can be a promising method to regulate the catalytic activity of a 2D nanomaterial. The distinct atomic interface between single metal sites and 2D platforms can reach the accurate inﬂection of the local direction of the environment and electronic structures. Defect engineering and vacancy engineering are considered an appropriate method for modifying the physicochemical features and electronic structure of 2D Nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 22: Doping nanomaterials with heteroatoms is an eﬀective method. Non-metal-atom doping and metal-atom  dop-ridden non-metal atom doping are its two categories. N-doped graphene is the most common doping material. N atom could be co-activated by the energy valence levels of N dopants, which are in turn tempt to a synergistically improved reaction mechanism. N atoms could be used to create single-atom catalysts on a support structure.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 23: The HER activity of carbon nanostructures greatly relies on the chemical potential at curvatures. Pyrrolic (edge site), pyridinic ( edge site), and quaternary (edge and graphitic) sites are identified as the probable structures in this situation. N-doped graphene has better catalytic activity than S-doping graphene. S-Doped graphene can be enhanced by plasma etching for the sake of the increasing densities of doping and defects. The activity of the MoS2-based and Pt-based electrocatalysts is static lesser than those of theMoS2 and Pt.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 24: Multiple-atom-doped  graphene nanosheets (N/P, N/S, N∕Bdopants) showed greater performance for HER. The density of the exposed  active sites is dominated by the intrinsic activity and the catalytic activity of active centers. The amount of active sites can be enhanced through doping of the single metal in 2D nanomaterials. The shape of pristine triangular MoS2 can be altered by Co incorporation. This subject to a better length of active edges.\n",

            "Summary for chunk 26: An appropriate  synthesis  method is essential in order to design  a very eﬃcient  electrocatalyst. A cheap or capable produc-tion approach applies to synthesize  the catalysts with exceptional performance. The crystal structure  and electronic morphology of the catalyst are controlled by the synthesis conditions. Chemical  vapor deposition (CVD) is a process that involves the reaction of two or more gaseous raw components to generate solid components, which are subsequently deposited on a substrate or catalyzed by other surfaces.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 27: CVD is used to prepare transition metal sulﬁdes, graphene-supporting materials, and other water electrolyzer  catalysts. It is easy to control the CVD method and the particle shape of the produced catalyst is narrow. The downsides include the high production costs of mass-producing   huge numbers of items, which are considered  ﬂaws. The inﬂuence of the structure of layered materials on their properties is particularly remarkable. The expansion of active sites is regarded as the gain of these constructions.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 28: Electrochemical  deposition is a method that allows  for the direct creation of a coating. It is practiced to prepare electrodes with micro-nanostructure in the water electrolyzer experiment. The stability of single 2D layers  is not as good as that of heterostructures. The major aim of a hydrogen economy is for hydrogen to be produced primarily from reliable energy sources. Using hydrogen as a fuel is considered as one of the best greener   alternatives to fossil fuels.\n",
            "Summary for chunk 29: Hydrogen energy density is roughly 2.5-3 times greater than usually used fossil fuels. The produced hydrogen is used by the fuel cell vehicle to generate power and then for electricity. Hydrogen energy will be used in all aspects of life. The main factors   touching lifecycle cost comprise investment expenditures, production cost, storage costs, market price, supply cost, and demand. The development problem of bringing  out the electrolysis of water at realistic eﬁciencies appears  to  obstructing progress in understanding this currently.\n",
