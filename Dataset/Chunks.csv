"Researchers have developed a metal-free electrocatalyst based on boron carbon nitride nanosheets (BCN NSSs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The BCN NSSs are synthesized through a simple and cost-effective method involving the self-assembly of fullerene and BCN NSSs in isopropyl alcohol. The resulting BCN NSSs exhibit excellent OER performance, requiring a low overpotential of only 260 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is comparable to that of the benchmark RuO2 catalyst.

"Surface photocatalysts are susceptible to degradation and corrosion over time, impacting their stability and long-term performance. Additionally, photocatalysts may exhibit selective activity toward either hydrogen or oxygen evolution, resulting in imbalanced gas production. Achieving balanced and simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen evolution is crucial for efficient water splitting. The amount of energy required to break the water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen is high, and maintaining the necessary energy input from sunlight while ensuring efficiency is challenging. The kinetics of water-splitting reactions play a vital role in determining overall efficiency. Slow reaction rates, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), limit the practicality of photocatalytic water splitting systems. Enhancing the catalytic activity and optimizing reaction pathways are ongoing challenges. The presence of dissolved oxygen in water competes with the desired reactions, leading to a reduction in overall efficiency. Oxygen acts as a scavenger of photogenerated electrons, hindering their participation in water reduction. Strategies to minimize the interference of dissolved oxygen are essential. Despite the challenges, MXenes have attracted significant interest in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their adjustable architectures, high electrical conductivity, and extensive redox surface-active sites. Their electronic structure and photocatalytic activities can be optimized using various techniques, including surface functional group termination, heteroatom doping, and the formation of carefully designed hybrids. However, the use of MXene-based materials in photocatalysis still encounters challenges, including the exploration of new MXene compositions and modifications, the development of scalable synthesis methods, and the integration of MXenes into real-world devices and systems. Combining photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is also being studied to synergize the advantages of both processes. Tailoring MXene structures to improve electrocatalytic activity and promoting efficient water splitting in electrolysis cells are important areas of research. Enhancing the stability, durability, and preventing agglomeration of MXenes are essential for their practical applications. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial to accelerate progress and foster innovative solutions for various real-world problems."

Photocatalytic water splitting uses semiconductors to absorb light and generate electron-hole pairs for water splitting. Nanomaterials enhance the process by increasing light absorption and improving efficiency. However, research is ongoing to improve the efficiency and scale of hydrogen production using these methods."
"Water electrolysis is a promising technology for green hydrogen production, but the development of efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a challenge. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted attention due to their tunable porosity and active sites. Zhao et al. prepared a MOF with hierarchical porosities, including macropores, mesopores, and micropores, which facilitated mass transport and provided abundant active sites. This NiFe-MOF catalyst exhibited excellent activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Similarly, Lin et al. synthesized a NiFe-MOF with a yarnball-like structure and high surface area, which resulted in accelerated water splitting.

However, challenges remain in scaling up production and ensuring long-term stability under harsh reaction conditions. Further research is needed to optimize synthesis methods, improve stability, and develop environmentally friendly and cost-effective catalysts for practical applications."
"The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of a heterostructure consisting of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and TiO2 was found to be 2.3 mmol g-1 h-1 and 1.2 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively, under visible light irradiation. The photoexcited electrons in CQDs were transferred to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, facilitating the photocatalytic reaction. Triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as an electron donor and hole scavenger to regenerate the photocatalyst system.

Surface modification of TiO2 nanocrystals with organic ligands, such as formamide (FA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulted in improved light harvesting and photocatalytic activity. The interaction between the TiO2 nanocrystals and the ligands led to the formation of deep electronic states. FA acted as a capping and nitriding agent, creating deep and shallow trapping states, while PEG enhanced visible light absorption.

Nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) synthesized using urea as a dopant source exhibited a bandgap of 2.0 eV and was used in dye-sensitized photochemical reactions. The dye acted as a sensitizer, injecting electrons into the CB of TiO2 upon excitation. The electrons were then transferred to an electron acceptor, regenerating the sensitizer.

Surface charge modification of TiO2 can be achieved by controlling the pH of the solution. The amphoteric nature of TiO2 allows it to interact with charged compounds, influencing the photocatalytic degradation of polar and ionic substrates.

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an n-type semiconductor commonly used in photocatalytic systems due to its excellent properties, ease of synthesis, and low cost.

To improve the efficiency of electron-hole pair separation in ZnO-based photocatalytic systems, various strategies have been employed, such as bandgap engineering, impurity level introduction, organic material sensitization, and heterostructure construction. Heterostructures made of ZnO and CdS have shown improved photocatalytic activity due to the formation of a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system.

Metal sulfides, such as CdS, MoS2, WS2, PbS, SnS, InS, NiS, CuS, SnS2, and ZnIn2S4, have attracted attention for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction due to their high photocatalytic activity, abundance of exposed active sites, and suitable band structures."
"Ultrathin CdXZnxS/TiC MXene composites exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between CdXZnxS and TiC MXene. This facilitates rapid separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, leading to a high rate of hydrogen production (mol g-1 h-1) under visible light irradiation. The addition of TiC to ZnS nanoparticles further improves photocatalytic hydrogen generation, with the resulting ZNS-NPs/MXene composite showing an enhanced hydrogen yield (mol g-1 h-1) compared to pure ZNS.

The work function of TiC MXene influences the photocatalytic activity of the composite. Bare TiC MXene with different terminations (AF, AO, and GH) exhibits varying work functions, affecting the charge transfer process. The calculated work function of mixed termination groups on TiC MXene provides insights into the electronic interactions at the interface.

Hierarchical hybrids of ZnInS microspheres and TiC-OHx have also shown promising photocatalytic activity. The layered morphology of TiC-OHx facilitates the immobilization of cationic metals (ZnIn) in aqueous solution. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation yield of ZnInS/TiC-OHx hybrids increases with the mass of TiC-OHx added during synthesis. The proposed mechanism involves the migration of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of ZnInS to the conduction band of TiC-OHx, resulting in the accumulation of electrons on TiC-OHx and the generation of hydrogen.

"Metal sulfides, such as CdS, are promising photocatalysts for visible light-driven water splitting due to their narrow band gaps and high photocatalytic activity. However, the photocatalytic degradation of metal sulfides in water limits their practical applications.

One strategy to prevent photocatalytic degradation is to use sacrificial electron-donating reagents, such as Na2S or Na2SO3. These reagents react with the photogenerated holes, preventing them from oxidizing the photocatalyst.

Another strategy is to form solid solutions of metal sulfides with other semiconductors, such as ZnO or ZnS. This can lead to a narrowing of the band gap and enhanced visible light absorption. For example, the solid solution Cd x Zn1-x S has a tunable band gap and can be tailored for optimal visible light absorption.

The photocatalytic activity of CdS-based photocatalysts can also be enhanced by doping with transition metals, such as Ni, Cu, or Pb. This can lead to the formation of new energy levels within the band gap, which can facilitate charge separation and improve the photocatalytic activity.

Overall, metal sulfides are promising candidates for visible light-driven water splitting, and their photocatalytic activity can be further enhanced by using sacrificial electron-donating reagents, forming solid solutions, or doping with transition metals."
"Tantalate- and niobate-based photocatalysts have been studied for visible light-driven water splitting. Partial substitution of oxygen atoms with nitrogen atoms in these materials causes hybridization of p orbitals, leading to a narrowing of the band gap and enhanced visible light absorption.

Among the tantalate photocatalysts, TaON, SrTaO2N, CaTaO2N, and BaTaO2N have been investigated. These materials have band gaps ranging from 2.4 to 2.8 eV, allowing them to absorb visible light up to 520-550 nm.

The photocatalytic activity of these materials can be further enhanced by doping with metal ions or by forming solid solutions with other metal oxides. For example, doping TaON with tungsten or vanadium has been shown to improve its visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity.

Overall, tantalate- and niobate-based photocatalysts are promising candidates for visible light-driven water splitting due to their relatively narrow band gaps and high photocatalytic activity."
"Doping semiconductors with impurities can enhance their photocatalytic response to visible light. Cation doping involves replacing a cation in the semiconductor lattice with another element, which results in a contraction of the band gap and the injection of energy levels within the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). This facilitates the movement of photogenerated charge carriers to the surface to oxidize and reduce water, enhancing the efficiency and bringing the visible portion of the solar spectrum into play.

Anion doping is an alternative method to develop visible-light response in large band gap UV-active photocatalytic materials. By mixing the p atomic orbital of the anion with the p orbital of oxygen in the VB, the band gap energy is decreased, raising the VB closer to the CB and effectively making the UV-active semiconductor visible-light-active.

Both cation and anion doping can introduce defects and oxidation states of oxygen that act as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers. However, careful selection of dopants and doping methods can minimize these negative effects and optimize the photocatalytic performance.

Various chemical techniques, such as precipitation and impregnation, are used to dope different metals into host semiconductor structures, resulting in visible-light response. Transition metals, antimony, tantalum, chromium, zinc, and carbon are commonly used dopants.

Band gap engineering, which involves the conversion of UV-active photocatalysts into visible light photocatalysts, is achieved through cation and anion doping. By capturing solar radiation to the maximum extent, doped semiconductors can enhance the quantum yield of water splitting."
"Electrode stability is a major challenge for MXenes in overall water splitting applications. To address this issue, various strategies have been developed to prevent oxidation and ensure stability during the water electrolysis process. One approach is to grow a protective layer on the MXene surface. For example, Lim et al. used in situ vulcanization to grow MoS2 on Mo2TiC2Tx (Mo-CTX), forming a Mo-CTX/MoS2 composite. This composite exhibited excellent HER catalytic activity and stability in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolyte environments. The MoS2 layer acts as an insulating layer that prevents the oxidation of Mo-CTX. Another method is to introduce hydrophobic coatings onto the MXene surface. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and trimethoxy(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl)silane have been used to prevent direct contact between water molecules and MXenes, thus reducing oxidation. Additionally, hydrogen annealing and high-energy mechanical milling can improve the environmental stability of MXenes by reducing the number of defects and increasing the specific surface area. Despite these advances, the oxidation of MXenes remains a concern for their commercial application in overall water splitting. Therefore, further studies are needed to analyze the micro-oxidation process of MXenes during water splitting and develop MXene-based composites with high oxidation resistance and excellent catalytic activity. Long-term stable storage of MXenes is also an urgent problem to be solved. Aqueous etching agents used in MXene synthesis can lead to oxidation when stored in water environments. To address this issue, methods have been proposed to cover the edges of MXenes with anions from organic or inorganic salts, creating an ion shielding effect that delays oxidation. However, these methods may not be suitable for practical large-scale storage. Therefore, exploring low-cost, green, and easily industrialized long-term storage routes for MXenes remains a challenge for their application in water splitting."
"MXene-based materials have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for overall water splitting due to their high catalytic activity, competitive reaction selectivity, wide pH application range, corrosion resistance, and long-term stability in seawater environments. The synthesis of MXenes through molten salt etching and electrochemical etching enables their application as cathode and anode materials for hydrogen and oxygen production, respectively. MXenes offer advantages of renewable raw materials, green environmental protection, and effectiveness in solving the energy crisis and environmental pollution caused by fossil energy. Their catalytic activity is related to the number of active sites, intrinsic activity, and single-site electrocatalytic performance, which can be enhanced by exposing active sites, active edges, and atomic vacancies. Doping elements and adjusting functional groups can further improve the intrinsic activity and active sites. Defect regulation and surface modification of MXenes enhance their stability and conductivity, while compounding with positive materials via electrostatic force electrodeposition creates composites with improved catalytic activity. Studies have shown that MXenes combined with noble metals, metal-organic frameworks, and other materials promote oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions. However, further research is needed to focus on doping, nanostructure modification, and the catalytic mechanism of MXenes in overall water splitting. The use of seawater under neutral conditions for water electrolysis holds promise for solving the problem of easy corrosion of electrolyzers in strong alkaline or acidic conditions, reducing the cost of water electrolysis and promoting green chemistry."
"MXenes, a class of two-dimensional materials, have attracted attention for their potential as electrocatalysts due to their unique properties and high surface area. The electrochemical properties of MXenes are influenced by their surface terminations, which can affect their charge-transfer resistance, proton adsorption kinetics, and active site reactivity. Ti<sub>x</sub>C MXene nanosheets with abundant F termination groups exhibit low charge-transfer resistance and high active site density, resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations have shown that the number of F termination atoms on the Ti<sub>x</sub>C surface affects the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, with a near-zero value indicating an ideal electrocatalyst. The presence of F termination groups on the Ti<sub>x</sub>C surface also promotes faster proton adsorption kinetics, leading to higher cathodic current densities and outstanding activity. MXenes with different transition metal components exhibit varying electrical properties. Vanadium-based MXene (VMXene) has been investigated as a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. VMXene-based hybrid materials, such as NiS/VMXene and NiS/Ti<sub>x</sub>C/VMXene, have shown enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to pure VMXene. The sandwich-like design of these hybrid materials facilitates electron migration and mass diffusion, resulting in improved reaction kinetics and catalytic performance. Density functional theory simulations have confirmed the superior activity of VMXene compared to other MXenes, with a lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. The presence of F termination groups on the VMXene surface further enhances its electrocatalytic activity. However, controlling the surface terminations of MXenes during synthesis remains a challenge, leading to mixed termination groups and variations in their electrochemical properties."
"Nitride MXenes, a relatively new class of MXenes, have attracted attention for their potential in water splitting applications. However, their synthesis is challenging due to the stronger N-Ti bond compared to the C-Ti bond in carbide MXenes. This stronger bond requires higher energy to form, resulting in the formation of multilayer nitride MXenes, which are difficult to etch into single-layer or few-layer structures. Consequently, only four types of nitride MXenes have been experimentally verified to date. Current methods for preparing nitride MXenes face challenges related to low yield, complex post-processing, and the lack of suitable stratification methods to obtain stable single-layer or few-layer materials. Compared to carbide MXenes, research on the application of nitride MXenes is limited, with only a few studies exploring their use in water splitting. DFT calculations predict that nitride MXenes may have a larger active surface area, higher conductivity, and better metal characteristics than carbide MXenes, leading to potentially higher catalytic activity for water splitting. Additionally, nitrogen atoms provide stronger N-H bonds and better mechanical stability compared to carbon atoms. Unlike C-based MXenes, the catalytic activity of TiNTx mainly comes from basal sites rather than edge sites. The catalytic mechanism of TiNTx for water splitting may differ from the conventional Volmer-Heyrovsky steps. However, the specific mechanism and the effects of structure and electronic properties on the catalytic activity of nitride MXenes remain largely unknown. The development of cost-effective and efficient methods for preparing nitride MXenes is crucial for their application in water splitting. Furthermore, research is needed to explore the catalytic mechanisms of nitride MXenes and to design stable and active materials for seawater splitting."

The Co-Ru-N-C catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral solutions. In alkaline solution, Co-Ru-N-C achieved overpotentials of 248 mV and 278 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> (280 mV and 320 mV).

"Mxenes, a family of two-dimensional materials, have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for overall water splitting due to their unique electronic structure and surface chemistry. The dissociation of water molecules on mxene surfaces involves several steps, including adsorption, migration, and diffusion of H and OH intermediates. The adsorption energy of water molecules on mxenes depends on the type of mxene, the adsorption site, and the electronic structure of the mxene. Transition metal-based carbide mxenes exhibit higher water dissociation activity compared to nitride mxenes, and the dissociation energy is lower for d-transition metals compared to d-metals.

The overall water splitting process on mxene-based electrocatalysts involves the adsorption of water molecules, dissociation into H and OH intermediates, and subsequent electrochemical reactions to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases. The catalytic activity of mxenes is influenced by the presence of functional groups on the surface, with oxygen-terminated mxenes exhibiting higher activity.

For instance, numerous researchers have concentrated on developing d-based heterostructured materials and optimizing hierarchical structures to enhance electrochemical performance. There is a need to rectify various technological issues. Discussions on d-based photoelectrocatalysts aim to enhance charge transfer ability and improve electrochemical properties. Another drawback is the difficulty in obtaining consistent and reproducible results due to the challenges in controlling the growth of large surface area materials with defect-free, uniform thickness, and order. To construct materials with better integration with existing materials, novel fabrication approaches are necessary. Catalytic performance of materials can be enhanced by incorporating conducting materials to form hybrid materials. Additionally, it is necessary to investigate the variation in monolayers and multilayers of materials, heterojunction characteristics, and the effect of hybridization and surface modification in greater detail. Notably, ultrathin materials significantly lose their intrinsic properties over time, thus new techniques must be developed to store materials for longer periods without causing them to lose their intrinsic properties. Moreover, materials are often found to encounter brittle-ductile failure, making it important to investigate materials in terms of their mechanical strength and related material defects. Theoretical models like DFT calculations are an effective way to study the electronic and electrochemical behaviors of materials. There are also opportunities in the field due to recent technological advancements."

"Mxenes, a class of two-dimensional materials, have shown promising potential as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The electronic structure of mxenes, particularly the d-band position of the transition metal, plays a crucial role in determining the adsorption strength of intermediates and the catalytic activity. Molybdenum-based mxenes, such as Mo2TiC2Tx, exhibit a suitable d-band electronic structure and optimal adsorption strength for hydrogen intermediates, resulting in high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

To further enhance the catalytic activity of mxenes, various strategies have been employed, including surface modification, interface coupling, and doping.

"Proton-coupled electron transfer processes on catalyst surfaces involve the interaction of reactants, products, and oxygen-containing intermediates, with the adsorption and release of OH and OOH playing crucial roles. The binding strength of these intermediates influences the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A moderate binding strength is desirable to balance adsorption and desorption. The difference in binding energy between OOH and OH determines the overpotential, and both must be optimized simultaneously. The ideal catalyst exhibits an optimum binding strength for intermediates, leading to high activity. However, strong oxygen binding can limit kinetics, while weak binding can lead to increased overpotential. The binding energy of OOH and OH can be adjusted by modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst surface through methods such as doping, alloying, and strain adjustment. This linear relationship between the adsorption energies of oxygen-containing intermediates affects the reaction steps, with a high potential in favor of adjusting the surface catalyst to overcome the proportional relationship and achieve high activity. The covalent nature of the metal-oxygen bond plays a role in this process, and the electronic counting rule influences the slope and intercept of the adsorption energy scaling relationship. The distinction between the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) in metal oxides is based on the transfer of electrons between the metal d-band and oxygen p-band, affecting the formation of oxygen vacancies and the electrophilicity of lattice oxygen atoms."

"Semiconductors, including CdS, ZnS, and their solid solutions, have been investigated for photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation. Modifying the band gap of these materials through doping or the formation of solid solutions can enhance their photocatalytic activity. For example, Cd x Zn 1-x S solid solutions exhibit a tunable band gap and photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. The concentration of zinc in the solid solution affects the band gap, electronic states, and charge carrier mobility, influencing the photocatalytic reaction rate. Thermal treatment can induce structural changes in Cd x Zn 1-x S, leading to increased crystallinity and higher catalytic activity.

"The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes involves various catalytic mechanisms, including the electrochemical oxide path, metal peroxide path, Krasil'shchikov path, Wade-Hackerman path, and DFT-predicted peroxide path. In the electrochemical oxide path, OH is adsorbed on the active site, followed by oxidation to O and OOH intermediates, which then combine to form O2. In the metal peroxide path, OH is oxidized to OOH, which then disproportionates to form O2 and H2O. The Krasil'shchikov path involves the formation of an OO intermediate, which then reacts with H+ to form OOH. The Wade-Hackerman path involves the formation of an OH intermediate, which then reacts with H+ to form H2O and O. The DFT-predicted peroxide path involves the formation of an OOH intermediate, which then reacts with OH- to form O2 and H2O.

In alkaline electrolytes, the OER mechanism involves the formation of OH- and O2- intermediates. OH- is adsorbed on the active site, followed by oxidation to O and OOH intermediates, which then combine to form O2. O2- can also be formed through the direct coupling of two OH- intermediates.

"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a widely used photocatalyst for hydrogen production due to its physical and chemical properties. This study reviews hydrogen energy production using TiO2 and titanate-based photocatalysts, discussing their pros and cons. The mechanism of photocatalysis is elaborated to identify factors for optimizing photocatalyst performance. The chief characteristics and limitations of TiO2 photocatalysts are assessed. TiO2-based photocatalysts modified with transition metals, transition metal oxides, noble metals, graphitic carbon nitride, graphene, etc. are reviewed. The study provides a basic understanding for beginners and detailed knowledge for experts in the field to optimize TiO2-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Hydrogen is considered an ideal fuel due to its lifecycle renewability, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. It can be produced from renewable and non-renewable energy resources, with solar and wind energy being suitable for clean hydrogen production. However, only 4% of hydrogen is derived from renewable sources due to high costs. Scientists are exploring cost-effective hydrogen production methods, leading to the development of photovoltaic water electrolysis using semiconductor materials with small bandgaps. Alternatively, photocatalytic water splitting using TiO2 as a photocatalyst is promising for clean, low-cost, and environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Photocatalytic reactions occur when semiconductor materials absorb photons with energy equal to or greater than their bandgap, creating electron-hole pairs. These photogenerated electrons reduce H+ ions to H2, while holes on the semiconductor surface decompose H2O into O2 and H+. The behavior of these photogenerated carriers significantly influences the performance of a semiconductor photocatalyst. Understanding and controlling their behavior can lead to efficient photocatalysts with a wide range of applications in environmental and energy-related fields. For example, photogenerated charge carrier recombination can limit photocatalyst efficiency. Controlling the transfer and migration of generated carriers can increase efficiency by spatially separating carriers and elongating their lifetime. The overall mechanism of water splitting and hydrogen production is explained in the following equations: TiO2 + hv → TiO2 (e− CB + h+ VB) 2H+ + 2e− CB → H2 2H2O + 4h+ VB → O2 + 4H+ The overall reaction can be summarized as: H2O + hv → H2 + 1/2O2 Titanium(IV) oxide naturally exists in two phases, rutile and anatase, with a tetrahedral shape and simple synthesis. The third phase, brookite, is synthesized in laboratories and has a rhombic shape.

Turnover frequency (TOF), the number of active sites per unit time, evaluates the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, with higher values indicating better activity. Exchange current density, the intercept of the Tafel plot, reflects the bonding and charge transfer between reactants and catalysts. The free energy of adsorption of intermediates is related to the Tafel slope and exchange current density, providing further understanding of the catalytic process.

"Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for hydrogen production. This review presents different modifications applied to semiconductors to improve their performance in photocatalytic water splitting. Heterostructures are also introduced and reviewed. The mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting involves three major steps: photogeneration of electron-hole pairs, spatial charge separation and migration of charge carriers to the surface, and photocatalytic reaction and evolution of H2. The overall efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting depends on the balance of thermodynamics and kinetics of these three major steps. In recent years, different semiconductors have been used for photocatalytic water splitting. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a widely used n-type semiconductor with a suitable band gap and redox potential for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, TiO2 has a large band gap and high rate of photogenerated charge carrier recombination. Several strategies have been utilized to overcome these shortages, including non-metal and metal doping, surface modifications, dye sensitization, and construction of heterojunctions. These strategies enhance light harvesting and photocatalytic performance of TiO2."
"Recent advancements in visible-light-active photocatalysts have been achieved through material formulation techniques. By tailoring the morphology and crystallinity of photocatalysts, including structural defects, significant improvements in water splitting efficiency under visible light have been made. Titanium oxide-based photocatalysts, despite their inherent wide band gap, have been modified using various methods to enhance their visible-light activity. Doping with metal ions (e.g., Fe, V, Co, Cr, Ni) has been employed, but often results in limited efficiency gains. Codoping with anions (e.g., Sb, N, C, P) has been investigated to prevent the formation of Cr ions and lattice defects. Metal titanites (e.g., SrTiO3, LaTiO3) have shown promise as visible-light photocatalysts, but require doping with transition metal ions (e.g., Cr, Ta, Crs) to become active. Ion implantation has also been used to modify TiO2 thin films with cations (e.g., V, Cr), resulting in photoactivity under visible light. Tantalate and niobate-based photocatalysts have been explored due to their structural irregularities that enhance UV light absorption. However, their high band gaps limit their visible-light activity. Recently, titanium disilicate (TiSi2) has emerged as a potential photocatalyst for water splitting under visible light irradiation."

"Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen production due to its visible light absorption and appropriate bandgap. However, several disadvantages, such as low surface area, poor electrical conductivity, and fast recombination of electron-hole pairs, limit its photocatalytic activity. To overcome these challenges, various strategies have been employed to improve the surface area, enhance optoelectronic properties, and create nanoscale g-C3N4.

"Advancements in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have led to breakthroughs in hydrogen production, with MXene-metal sulfide photocatalysts playing a revolutionary role. Ti3C2Tx MXene as a cocatalyst has demonstrated exceptional performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production, while MXenes have also shown promise in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. In water treatment, MXenes have been explored as photocatalysts for photocatalytic water treatment, and MXene-supported semiconductors have been used as photocatalysts for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting, CO conversion, and dye degradation. This work outlines the mechanisms involved in MXene photocatalysis, presents a systematic synthesis approach for MXene and MXene-based materials, and discusses the possible applications of these materials in photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The paper also highlights the challenges and future outlook for MXenes as effective catalysts. MXenes, with their unique structure and properties, represent thin layers of transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides. They are typically synthesized using hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution to selectively remove the A layer from the MAX phase, where M represents a transition metal, X represents carbon and/or nitrogen, and A represents an element from groups 13 or 14 of the periodic table. MAX phases have an alternate layering of hexagonal MX layers with an intercalation of hexagonal close-packed A atoms. Etching removes the A atoms, resulting in MXenes with octahedrally arranged M atoms. The structure and properties of MXenes can be tailored by varying the etching conditions and the choice of starting materials. Computational modeling and simulations have been used to study the atomic structure and electronic properties of MXenes. The lattice parameters of MXenes vary depending on the composition and the number of layers. Hydrothermal, solvothermal, and electrostatic etching methods are commonly used for the synthesis of MXenes. The hydrothermal method involves etching the MAX phase in an HF solution followed by vacuum filtration and washing. MXenes can also be modified by combining them with other compounds, such as metal oxides, sulfides, and nitrides, to form composites. These composites can exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the synergistic effects between the MXene and the other components."
"A study demonstrated the synthesis of a Z-scheme heterojunction of LaFeO3-graphene-g-C3N4 nanosheets, which exhibited an exceptional hydrogen production rate of 18.5 μmol g-1 h-1. Microscopic analysis revealed the uniform development of LaFeO3 microparticles covered with g-C3N4 nanosheets. The graphene-C-O-Fe bond at the heterojunction functioned as an electron carrier, facilitating increased redox reactions. A Schottky heterojunction comprising black TiO2 and g-C3N4 nanoscale hollow cores with a pore size of 5-10 nm was also created. Using Mg as the catalyst, a high hydrogen generation rate of 16.2 μmol g-1 h-1 was obtained, significantly higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.5 μmol g-1 h-1). A metallic heterojunction of CdS nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets, prepared via chemical precipitation, showed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation due to facilitated charge separation and reduced corrosion of CdS. Various g-C3N4-based heterojunctions involving metallic and carbonaceous materials, such as carbon nanofibers, carbon quantum dots, TiO2, and nickel nanoparticles, have been fabricated for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exceptional hydrogen production efficiencies. MXenes, a novel class of two-dimensional metallic nitrides/carbides, have also been extensively studied for photocatalysis. MXenes, typically synthesized from MAX phases by selective etching of the A element (IIIA/IVA group), have the formula M n+1 X n T x, where M is a transition metal, X is nitrogen and/or carbon, and T x represents various surface terminations. Although initially used in energy storage applications due to their high electrical conductivity and surface area, MXenes have recently gained attention in photocatalysis. MXene-transition metal oxide/sulfide composites have shown exceptional properties. TiO2, a common transition metal oxide, is widely used as a photocatalyst, but its large bandgap limits its absorption to UV light and promotes high electron-hole recombination. To overcome these disadvantages, Schottky junctions can be created by combining MXenes with TiO2. The Schottky barrier prevents electron-hole recombination, resulting in more electrons participating in hydrogen production. MXene-TiO2 composites have been synthesized by various methods, including the synthesis of carbon-doped TiO2 nanosheets using TiC Tx MXene as a precursor. The resulting nanosheets exhibited enhanced catalytic ability under visible light due to the structural characteristics of MXene and the carbon deposited on their surface. Another study reported the construction of a TiO-TiC composite via a hydrothermal process followed by photodeposition. The composite showed exceptional visible light absorption capabilities, and the hydrogen evolution rate of the p-TiO-TiC-TiO photocatalyst was significantly higher than that of TiC-TiO and TiO2. Dual-phase assembly techniques have also been used to create TiC-TiO nanocomposites, with TiO2 nanoparticles arranged in a 3D structure. MXenes have also been used to create heterojunctions with g-C3N4. A Z-scheme heterojunction of TiC-g-C3N4 exhibited a 3-fold increase in hydrogen production compared to plain TiO2, attributed to enhanced light absorption and charge separation efficiency. Transitional metal sulfides, such as ZnS, CdS, and MoS2, have also been successfully exploited as photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. By compositing MXenes, the disadvantages of these materials can be compensated. For instance, CdS nanorods composited with TiC MXene nanosheets via a Schottky heterojunction showed a 2-fold increase in hydrogen production compared to CdS rods alone. Overall, the combination of MXenes with other materials, such as TiO2, g-C3N4, and transitional metal sulfides, offers promising avenues for the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production."

Tantalum sulfide (TaS2) heterostructures with TiO2 nanoparticles have also shown improved photocatalytic activity.

Type II heterostructures, where the conduction band of one semiconductor is higher than that of the other and the valence band is lower, promote charge separation. In Type II CdS/ZnO heterostructures, electrons accumulate in the conduction band of CdS and holes in the valence band of ZnO, leading to efficient charge separation and enhanced hydrogen production.

Type III heterostructures, with a staggered band gap, also exhibit charge separation. In CdS/single-crystal ZnO nanorod heterostructures, electrons accumulate in the conduction band of CdS and holes in the valence band of ZnO, resulting in improved charge separation and increased hydrogen production efficiency.

Overall, heterostructures combining MoSe2, WS2, TaS2, and other semiconductors with complementary properties offer promising strategies for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency and overcoming the limitations of individual semiconductors."
"The electrocatalytic activity of transition metal-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is strongly influenced by the hydrogen adsorption free energy (GH). Mxenes, a class of two-dimensional materials, have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for HER due to their unique physical and chemical properties. The presence of abundant surface oxygen groups and high electrical conductivity in mxenes facilitates the adsorption and transfer of protons, making them efficient electrocatalysts. Among various mxenes, Ti3C2Tx has attracted significant attention due to its excellent HER performance. The surface termination groups (F or OH) on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets play a crucial role in determining the GH value and the overall HER activity. F-terminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets exhibit a lower GH and higher charge transfer rate, resulting in improved electrode kinetics and enhanced active site reactivity. The thickness of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets also affects the HER performance, with thinner nanosheets providing a higher density of active sites. Nb-based mxenes, particularly Nb2CTx, have also shown promising HER activity due to their excellent conductivity and near-zero DG for hydrogen adsorption. The incorporation of other elements, such as Pt nanoparticles or TiO2, into Ti3C2Tx or Nb2CTx further enhances their HER performance by optimizing the active sites and promoting charge transfer. Overall, mxenes and their derivatives hold great potential as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for HER, offering a promising avenue for the development of clean and sustainable hydrogen production."
"Gold-titanium dioxide (Au-TiO2) photocatalysts have shown promise for hydrogen production. Smaller gold particles on Au-TiO2 catalysts enhance hydrogen production by reducing formic acid decomposition, which produces carbon monoxide (CO). Platinum-TiO2 (Pt-TiO2) catalysts exhibit higher hydrogen production activity than Au-TiO2, but Au-TiO2 is more sensitive to preparation methods. Copper-doped TiO2 (Cu-TiO2) photocatalysts prepared by complex precipitation exhibit higher hydrogen production activity than those prepared by wet impregnation. The optimal Cu-TiO2 catalyst has a copper loading of 0.5% and a calcination temperature of 500°C. Transition metals like iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr) can be used as dopants to enhance the photocatalytic properties of TiO2. Fe-doped TiO2 has a higher hydrogen production rate than Cr-doped TiO2 due to its ability to trap both holes and electrons, preventing recombination. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-Cr-doped TiO2 photocatalysts with multiple ITO bilayers can reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance hydrogen production."
"Graphene enhances photocatalytic efficiency by promoting charge carrier transfer and separation, reducing electron-hole recombination, tuning the bandgap, providing support for adsorption catalytic sites, and acting as a cocatalyst for hydrogen production. Graphene's two-dimensional support and enhanced electrical and redox properties increase the surface area of the photocatalyst. A new structure of graphene in the form of nanosized graphene oxide with titanium dioxide (TiO2) exhibits a high rate of hydrogen production. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-TiO2 photocatalyst loaded over TiO2 can also be used as a photocatalyst in an alcohol solution under UV radiation. It was synthesized through the hydrothermal method, showing the best photocatalytic activity and performance. rGO-TiO2 contents in a ratio of 1:1 were used, and the titanium dioxide (prGO) was stable and could be used as a recyclable catalyst for the evolution of H2. Strong interaction between rGO and TiO2 suppresses the recombination process and enhances the photocatalytic performance. Recent studies have reported the peculiar behavior of modified TiO2 photocatalysts for enhancing the hydrogen production rate. Red phosphorus-modified TiO2 hollow spheres achieved the highest hydrogen production rate of 0.44 mmol/g·h. Bicd-TiO2 nanocomposites prepared via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method exhibited a 0.82 mmol/g·h hydrogen production rate. Anatase nanoparticle as a cocatalyst over TiO2 using a supercritical fluid process was investigated for hydrogen production and revealed a 0.35 mmol/g·h hydrogen production rate. Hydrogen energy has become an emerging renewable energy resource due to its environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and stable lifecycle. Photocatalysis is the most promising technique for hydrogen production, with TiO2 photocatalyst being the most widely used. The non-commercial boundaries of the process are due to catalyst limitations, which are analyzed in this review. The process can be improved by doping and modifying the catalyst with transition metals, noble metals, graphite, and graphene. This review provides insights into TiO2 and TiO2-based photocatalysts to choose the best and optimized photocatalyst for water splitting and hydrogen production. Effective preparation methods, sacrificial reagents, photocatalyst stability, and hydrogen transport and storage are factors that must be considered to achieve maximum hydrogen production activity. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen utilizing TiO2-based photocatalyst is an economical and effective way to acquire sustainable energy. Doping of various nonmetal and metal materials can increase the performance of the photocatalyst by carefully tuning the bandgap of the nanomaterials. The optimum amount of photocatalyst should be employed to achieve maximum hydrogen production activity."
"The combination of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with other materials has shown promise for enhanced photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performance. Decorating ZnS nanoparticles on TiC nanosheets improves hydrogen generation efficiency. CdS/TiC MXene nanocomposites can be synthesized via a simple solvothermal method, providing excellent photocatalytic activity due to the electron and ion shuttling properties of TiC nanosheets. In addition, TiC MXene-based hybrids have been explored for electrocatalysis.

These studies demonstrate the potential of MXene-based hybrids for efficient photocatalysis and electrocatalysis."
"Non-precious metal carbide-based carbon composites and non-metallic carbon-based electrocatalysts have attracted attention for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The modification of intermediate binding energy at the edge positions of non-precious metal carbide composites lowers the overpotential for OER. Non-metallic carbon-based electrocatalysts, such as heteroatom-doped carbon materials and graphene hybrid materials, exhibit promising OER activity due to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area. Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is a particularly effective metal-free OER catalyst, as the N atoms regulate the charge distribution and electronic structure of nearby carbon atoms. Layered exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) nanosheets, with their high carrier mobility and large specific surface area, can be coupled with graphene-based materials to form electrocatalysts for water oxidation.

"The synthesis of a nanoporous film of SrTiO3 (SrTiO3) with a disordered shell and a crystalline core (rSrTiO3) is reported. The disordered shell, approximately 1.5 nm thick, enhances the light absorption of SrTiO3 in the visible region due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The LSPR-induced hot electron-hole pairs facilitate water splitting, with the hot electrons transferring to the conduction band of the crystalline SrTiO3 core and the holes traveling to the external circuit to initiate the water reduction reaction. The flux-assisted method used to synthesize SrCoTaO4 (SrCoTaO4-F) at a relatively low temperature and short duration results in significantly enhanced photocatalytic capabilities compared to SrCoTaO4 synthesized via the conventional solid-state reaction method (SrCoTaO4). Notably, SrCoTaO4-F exhibits remarkable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities without the need for additional cocatalysts. MXene-based electrocatalysts, composed of transition metal carbides and nitrides, have attracted attention due to their advantageous characteristics, including substantial surface areas, high mobility energy densities, exceptional mechanical robustness, superior electrical conductivity, and customizable surface chemistry. Their excellent electrochemical properties and superior conductivity make them suitable for various applications, including supercapacitors, sodium-ion batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

For example, the grafting of semiconductor photoelectrode composed MXene-based ZnO nanorod arrays has led to significant enhancement in the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting reactions. Additionally, the development of cost-effective and highly efficient noble metal-free TiC MXene-based electrocatalysts has demonstrated enhanced performance for OER activities. The remarkable charge transfer capability of TiC MXene contributes to its improved performance. Furthermore, FeCo-layered double hydroxide grown on MXene catalyst using an in-situ technique has exhibited exceptional catalytic activity for overall water splitting, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at minimal overpotentials of 280 mV for OER and 240 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)."
"In photocatalytic Z-scheme heterostructures, an internal electric field and band energy bending facilitate charge separation and transfer. Photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 are transferred to the valence band (VB) of ZnIn2S4, while holes from the VB of ZnIn2S4 combine with electrons from the CB of TiO2. This prevents charge recombination and preserves the strong redox properties of the semiconductors.

Schottky heterojunctions, formed between a metal and a semiconductor, also promote charge separation. When a metal with a lower work function than the semiconductor comes into contact with the semiconductor, electrons flow from the semiconductor to the metal until equilibrium is reached. This creates a depletion region in the semiconductor near the interface, accumulating positive holes and negative electrons on opposite sides of the junction. The resulting potential barrier, called the Schottky barrier, restricts electron movement, preventing recombination.

Schottky-like barriers can also form between two semiconductors with different work functions, leading to similar charge separation effects.

Mxenes, a family of transition metal carbides and nitrides, have emerged as promising components in photocatalytic hydrogen production due to their high surface area, ultrathin layered atomic structure, and excellent electrical conductivity. Schottky heterojunctions formed between CdS nanorods and Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets enhance charge separation and improve photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can further enhance photocatalytic activity by increasing light absorption and generating hot electrons. Plasmonic nanoparticles, such as Au and Ag, can transfer energy from incident light to semiconductors, promoting charge separation and improving photochemical reactions.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, formed by stacking two nanolayers of semiconductors, offer tunable bandgaps and improved electron-hole separation. By combining semiconductors with different bandgaps, vdW heterostructures can harvest a wider range of the solar spectrum, enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.

Overall, the design and optimization of photocatalytic heterostructures, including Z-scheme, Schottky, and vdW heterostructures, are crucial for improving charge separation, light absorption, and surface reactivity, leading to enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency."
"Electron sinks and charge separation properties are crucial in photocatalysis. This study explores the use of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and titanium carbide (TiC) composites for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. The composites exhibit improved charge separation efficiency due to the strong bonding between lamellar g-C3N4 and TiC. TiC alone shows limited photocatalytic activity, while g-C3N4 has low activity under visible light. However, coupling g-C3N4 and TiC significantly enhances photocatalytic performance. The optimal g-C3N4 mass fraction of 10 wt% yields the highest hydrogen production rate, which is 11 times higher than pure g-C3N4. Excessive g-C3N4 coverage decreases the photocatalytic rate due to reduced active sites. The functional groups on TiC's surface provide active sites, while TiC's conductivity facilitates electron removal. The proposed mechanism involves the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to the conduction band of TiC, while holes transfer to the valence band of TiC. This charge separation enhances photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Furthermore, studies on g-C3N4-TiC-MoS2 composites and o-doped g-C3N4-TiC Schottky junctions demonstrate the synergistic effects of heterojunctions and interfacial contact in improving photocatalytic performance. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of g-C3N4-TiC composites for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production."

"The properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can be tailored by adjusting its bandgap, which is crucial for photocatalytic reactions. The number of layers in MoS2 affects its bandgap, with a single layer having a bandgap of 1.8 eV and bulk MoS2 having a bandgap of 1.3 eV. The redox potential of the valence band edge of MoS2 is also important for hydrogen evolution reactions, with a more negative potential being beneficial.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly semiconductor photocatalyst that is responsive to visible light. Various modifications have been made to g-C3N4 to enhance its photocatalytic performance, including loading single atoms on its basal plane, applying cocatalysts, and forming heterostructures. Thermal polymerization is a simple and cost-effective method for synthesizing g-C3N4.

The bandgap of g-C3N4 can be tuned by doping with other elements or forming heterojunctions with other semiconductors.

"MXenes, with their unique structure and surface terminations, offer a promising platform for creating heterojunction composites with improved photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activity. MXene-TiO2 hybrids exhibit high catalytic activity under visible and UV light irradiation due to their layered structure, which stimulates photogenerated charge separation. MXene-derived materials act as cocatalysts and form schottky junctions with TiO2, enhancing charge separation and reducing recombination. Future research should focus on optimizing synthesis conditions and exploring different MXene-semiconductor combinations to further improve photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performance.

MXene-metal oxide nanocomposites exhibit interesting properties and have limitless potential in various fields. Strategies for improving the effectiveness of MXene-based nanocomposites include investigating fundamental mechanisms of charge separation and catalytic activity. MXene-TiO2 nanohybrids have shown promise in different photocatalytic applications due to their easy synthesis, improved interlayer spacing, and enhanced optical absorbability. However, the performance of MXene-based composites is still lower than that of noble metal-based systems. Future research should focus on combining MXenes with various semiconducting materials, such as g-C3N4, CeO2, ZnO, MoS2, and BiVO4, to improve photocatalytic performance. MXenes hold promise as electrode materials for energy storage devices due to their advantages in avoiding restacking, improved electronic conductivity, stability, and easy ion/electron transfer. Future advancements in MXene synthesis will focus on developing materials with specific interlayer distances to enhance energy storage capabilities. MXene hybrid materials are expected to pave the way for research in energy storage applications."
"The efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting depends on the band positions of the semiconductor photocatalyst. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band maximum (CBM) must straddle the water oxidation and hydrogen evolution potentials to facilitate both half-reactions. Narrow bandgap semiconductors are prone to oxidation in the presence of oxygen, limiting their efficiency.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored various approaches, including sacrificial agents, two-step excitation (Z-scheme), and engineering the properties of photocatalysts. Band gap engineering, surface modification, and nanodesign are used to enhance charge separation, reduce recombination, and increase light absorption.

One-dimensional nanomaterials have received attention due to their reduced mass transfer resistance, enhanced charge separation, and increased light absorption. Researchers have fabricated various nanohybrids and nanostructures to improve photocatalytic performance.

Despite progress, the development of efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting using visible light remains a major challenge. Further research is needed to control the interdependence of electronic, surface, and microstructural properties to optimize photocatalyst performance and achieve industrial-scale hydrogen production."
"Through a novel approach, exfoliated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were synthesized, demonstrating enhanced electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. The doping of Ni into the Ti3C2Tx structure increased the number of active catalytic sites, leading to superior performance compared to previous catalysts. The use of Ti3C2Tx as a co-catalyst in photocatalytic systems has also been explored, showcasing its potential in promoting charge separation and enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.

"The incorporation of copper as a cocatalyst on TiO2-TiC-Ti3C2Tx (TiC-Ti3C2Tx) MXenes significantly enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) generation activity. The presence of metallic copper particles increases the activity tenfold, with a maximum rate of 123.6 μmol g-1 h-1. The addition of CuO nanoparticles decreases the active sites at the Cu-TiO interfaces, leading to decreased H2 generation and stability. The optimal CuO loading is determined to be 0.5 wt%, resulting in a stable photocatalyst with excellent H2 generation activity over five consecutive water splitting experiments. The mechanism of the ternary CuO-TiO-TiC-Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst is strongly influenced by the surface coverage of copper species. Monomer photocatalysts exhibit relatively poor photocatalytic activity due to the absence of active sites for H2 generation. The binary TiO-TiC-Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst shows good photocatalytic activity compared to pure CuO, indicating that the active sites for H2 generation are mainly located on the TiO-TiC-Ti3C2Tx surface. The addition of CuO nanoparticles significantly enhances the cumulative H2 generation, with the photocatalyst loaded with 0.5 wt% CuO showing the highest performance. As the loading amount of CuO nanoparticles increases, the H2 generation rate decreases, reaching a minimum of 29.2 μmol g-1 h-1 at 2.0 wt% CuO. This is attributed to the inadequate surface coverage of the photocatalyst by CuO, resulting in a decrease in the number of active sites. The charge transfer mechanism in the CuO-TiO-TiC-Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst is influenced by the CuO coverage. At low CuO coverage, the photogenerated holes are trapped by TiC-Ti3C2Tx, while the photogenerated electrons are collected by the CB of TiO. At high CuO coverage, the photogenerated holes flow to the VB of CuO, while the photogenerated electrons primarily move to the CB of CuO. This results in a decrease in the H2 generation rate. The developed TiC-Ti3C2Tx-CuO-N-doped graphene carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst demonstrates outstanding photocatalytic performance, with a rate of 123.6 μmol g-1 h-1."
"MXene-based nanocomposites have shown promising photocatalytic activity for water splitting reactions. The addition of CuS to MXene significantly enhances hydrogen generation rates. Ternary composites involving MXenes, metals, and g-C3N4 materials offer additional advantages. A ternary nanocomposite comprising Au, TiC MXene, and CdS nanoparticles exhibited a high hydrogen production rate of 11.4 mmol/g h under visible light. The incorporation of metallic sulfides into TiC MXene-based nanocomposites creates Type II Schottky heterojunctions, facilitating efficient charge transfer and improved light absorption. Ternary composites composed of g-C3N4, TiC MXene, and TiO2 also demonstrated exceptional hydrogen evolution rates due to the formation of close heterojunctions. Multilayer TiC MXene-g-C3N4 composites synthesized via etching and pyrolysis exhibited high photocatalytic activity due to the allocation of electrons between the valence band of g-C3N4 and the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in efficient electron-hole separation. MBenes, structural analogs of MXenes with B-C-N atoms replacing C-N atoms, have also shown enhanced activity when composited with g-C3N4 and CdS. A nanocomposite of NiCoB and CdS exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in hydrogen production compared to pristine CdS due to exceptional hole absorption and electron transfer. A nanoalloy comprising MnCdS and NiCoB demonstrated an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 32.7 mmol/g h, attributed to the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of MnCdS to NiCoB. Another study reported the creation of a nanocomposite of CoB and g-C3N4 via chemical reduction, resulting in enhanced light absorption and electron transfer, leading to an improved hydrogen evolution efficiency that exceeded that of a Pt-coated g-C3N4 catalyst. This summary highlights the promising potential of carbon-based nanocomposites, particularly those involving MXenes and MBenes, for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation."
"Electrocatalysts are typically synthesized using non-in situ methods, which limit the understanding of their working mechanisms due to the lack of real-time observations of reaction intermediates. In situ characterization techniques, such as Raman, Fourier transform infrared, and XAFS, have been developed to provide real-time insights into the valence electron distribution, catalytic active sites, and catalytic pathways. Bifunctional electrocatalysts, which facilitate both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, offer a deeper understanding of fundamental principles in full water splitting. However, the complexity and limitations of current computational methods hinder the investigation of activity origins in many electrocatalytic processes. Despite advancements in theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, the fundamental basis of active origin remains elusive. Bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit promising catalytic activity in alkaline water electrolysis, but their generalization to seawater electrolysis is still limited in practical applications. The development of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts requires a combination of theoretical calculations, experimental measurements, and advanced spectroscopic characterization to bridge the gap between theory and experiment. Systematic and comprehensive reviews, such as this one, aim to stimulate wider research attention and further advancements in nanomaterials and bifunctional electrocatalysts for full water splitting."
"Non-precious metal-doped carbon-based materials have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Doping with multiple elements can provide abundant active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Fe-Co-N-C composites exhibit superior OER activity, outperforming Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic effect of Fe and Co dopants in boosting OER catalytic activity. Graphdiyne (GDY), with its unique electronic properties and high robustness, serves as a suitable support material for OER electrocatalysts. Ni-Co-GDY heterojunctions demonstrate excellent OER performance in alkaline conditions due to the synergistic effect between Ni and Co. R-graphyne, a promising carbon allotrope, exhibits good OER performance when doped with group VIIIB elements (Ni, Rh). The synergistic effect between the metal dopants and R-graphyne enhances the antibonding characteristics and promotes the formation of an appropriate adsorption state for OER. Non-precious metal carbide-based carbon composites also show promising OER activity. The incorporation of non-precious metal elements into the carbon lattice creates active sites at the edge positions. The modification of the intermediate binding energy at these sites lowers the overpotential for OER. Overall, the doping of non-precious metals into carbon-based materials provides a versatile strategy for constructing efficient and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts."
"The adsorption energy of hydrogen on a catalyst surface is linearly related to the activation energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the adsorption capacity of hydrogen (g-h) a key descriptor for evaluating catalytic activity. The optimal g-h value is around 0 eV, indicating that the intermediate is easily adsorbed and desorbed on the active sites, maximizing the catalyst's activity. For example, platinum (Pt) catalysts exhibit the best performance with a g-h value of 0 eV. The volcano plot is a graphical representation that shows the correlation between the exchange current density (j) and the g-h value of different catalysts. Materials with better properties are located closer to the top of the volcano, indicating higher catalytic activity. A g-h value of 0 eV corresponds to the highest exchange current density, which is located on the left side of the volcano plot. A g-h value that is too negative (to the right of the volcano plot) means that the bond between the catalyst and hydrogen (H) is too strong, limiting the Heyrovsky reaction and Tafel reaction, which are key steps in the HER. Conversely, a g-h value that is too positive (to the left of the volcano plot) means that the bond between the catalyst and H is too weak, limiting the Volmer reaction, which is another key step in the HER. The volcano plot is a simplified model that does not consider the influence of the double layer and solvation effects. A more complete picture of the HER pathway can be obtained by considering the three-state diagram, which includes the initial state (H+), the intermediate state (H* adsorbed on the catalyst surface), and the final state (H2 gas). The catalytic activity of a material can be judged based on the free energy of the intermediate state. In addition to catalytic activity, the long-term stability of electrocatalysts is crucial for practical applications. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is commonly used to evaluate the stability of catalysts. The stability index number, proposed by Cherevko and colleagues, is a metric that combines the total amount of oxygen released and the amount of dissolved iridium to assess the stability of different catalysts. The Gogoh parameter is another metric used to evaluate the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The optimal Gogoh value is 0 eV, similar to the g-h value for HER catalysts. The d-band center of transition metals, based on d-band theory, can be used to predict the adsorption strength of adsorbates. The d-band orbitals can hybridize with the adsorbate orbitals to form bonding and antibonding orbitals. The occupancy of the antibonding orbitals increases the system's energy, making adsorption less favorable. Therefore, a lower d-band center energy leads to weaker adsorption of intermediates. Doping and compounding can adjust the electronic structure of catalyst surfaces and modify the d-band center, thereby tuning the adsorption strength of intermediates. By carefully controlling the d-band center and other descriptors, it is possible to design catalysts with optimal properties for specific electrochemical reactions."
"Graphene-derived substances, with their exceptional electrical conductivity, surface area adjustability, and mechanical performance, hold significant potential for electrochemical applications. Researchers have dedicated efforts to developing fabrication techniques to harness these attributes. A laser-induced technique was employed to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles on porous graphene, demonstrating promising electrocatalytic properties. Similarly, a hydrothermal method produced graphene quantum dots supported by cobalt nanoparticles, offering new avenues for exploring clean energy applications. A chemical vapor deposition strategy yielded a stacked nanofilm composed of graphene layers atop boron nitrogen-codoped graphene, showing promise as a durable electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. A cost-effective precipitation method enabled the fabrication of layered double hydroxides, which were combined with graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide to form superlattice-like hybrids. These hybrids exhibited exceptional performance in electrocatalytic assessments, attributed to the synergistic effect between the nanosheets and graphene. An in-situ phosphorization method yielded a co-graphene composite with a sandwich-like structure, highlighting the potential of graphene for enhanced electrocatalytic applications. The diverse fabrication techniques and impressive performances of graphene-based electrode materials suggest their promising future in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and other electrochemical applications."
"MXenes, with their hydrophilic surfaces, are promising electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. However, their instability due to large surface energy hinders their practical applications. Various methods, such as intercalation, porous structure formation, and composite formation, are employed to stabilize MXenes. The two half-reactions involved in overall water splitting are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). MXenes exhibit high activity for both HER and OER in acid and alkaline conditions. Research efforts focus on optimizing catalytic performance through doping, surface modification, defect control, porous structure construction, and composite formation. Despite their potential, challenges remain, including MXene oxidation and limited research on nitride MXenes. Understanding the reaction mechanisms and addressing these challenges is crucial for the development of efficient MXene-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting."
"The morphology and structure of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can significantly influence its photocatalytic activity for hydrogen (H2) generation. A hydrothermal approach was used to synthesize a unique MoS2/TiC heterostructure with a sphere-sheet morphology. This heterostructure exhibited a high H2 production rate, 18 times greater than pure MoS2. The close interaction between MoS2 and TiC facilitated efficient charge separation and provided additional active sites, enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The addition of TiC to MoS2/CdS catalysts also improved the H2 production rate, with an average increase of 11%. The high electrical conductivity of TiC promoted electron transport and reduced the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The incorporation of MoS2 further enhanced charge separation and provided additional active sites. The use of TiC-derived photocatalysts, including partially and completely oxidized MXenes, has also shown promise for photocatalytic H2 generation. A TiO2/TiC/MoS2 nanocomposite exhibited a high photocatalytic rate of 160 μmol/gh, due to the efficient charge separation at the heterojunction interfaces. A hydrothermal technique was also employed to synthesize TiO2 nanosheets on the surface of TiC MXenes, resulting in a significant enhancement in the photocatalytic H2 generation rate. The electrostatic self-assembly approach was used to prepare a TiC/TiO2 photocatalyst, which achieved a maximum H2 production rate of 120 mmol/gh. The deposition of PtO nanodots on TiC/TiO2 MXene composites further improved the photocatalytic H2 generation efficiency. The TiC MXene served as a hole acceptor, while the PtO nanodots captured electrons and inhibited the reverse oxidation reaction of H2. Overall, the rational design and synthesis of MoS2- and TiC-based photocatalysts with controlled morphology and structure have led to significant improvements in photocatalytic H2 generation efficiency."
"Integration of semiconductor-based electrode materials with various types of nanomaterials represents a promising avenue for advancing energy storage technology and mitigating environmental pollution. Cost-effective, flexible, and stable photocatalytic electrode materials offer significant advantages for green energy technology due to their unique structural arrangements, exceptional photo-electrocatalytic activity, and long cyclic durability. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based materials exhibit numerous advantages over conventional electrode materials, including their unique electronic structure, superior optical properties, good adaptability, and excellent porous electronic properties. Recent advancements have demonstrated that layered g-C3N4-based photocatalytic systems can efficiently generate fuel and energy from sunlight, offering promising potential for storing solar energy. Li et al. fabricated a heterostructured electrocatalyst by anchoring cobalt onto molybdenum nitride-based g-C3N4, which exhibited remarkable bifunctional activity, enhancing the overall efficiency of the water-splitting process. A novel approach was employed to fabricate a high surface area layered g-C3N4 material with enhanced incorporation of inverse spinel-type CoSnO. The resulting CoSnO/g-C3N4 nanohybrid electrode exhibited outstanding performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving low overpotentials of 250 mV and 280 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Furthermore, Wu et al. reported the synthesis of efficient bifunctional cobalt nitride supported on graphitic carbon composites using self-template strategies. The developed composite demonstrated the ability to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of 230 mV and 260 mV for the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Another report described the development of a bifunctional electrocatalyst of nickel molybdenum carbide supported on nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (NiMoC/NC) using a one-step pyrolysis technique. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for the OER, with a synergistic effect between the Ni and MoC shown to increase active sites, thereby reducing the energy barrier for electrochemical reactions and facilitating electron transfer. The catalyst achieved overpotentials of 230 mV and 290 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, in alkaline electrolytes. Additionally, the fabrication protocol for NiMoC/NC involved sandwiching the composite between layers of graphene. A novel pathway has been developed to convert low-value biomass like fish scales into high-value materials using a method for preparing NiMoC/NC composites. Furthermore, an electrocatalyst was developed by amalgamating cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) with g-C3N4 (CoFe LDH/g-C3N4) using a one-pot coprecipitation followed by in-situ nucleation techniques. The electrochemical performance of the CoFe LDH/g-C3N4 electrocatalyst for water-splitting reactions revealed that a potential of only 1.5 V was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, testing the stability of the CoFe LDH/g-C3N4 composite showed only slight changes in potential value over several hours of operation. The results clearly demonstrated the promising potential of the CoFe LDH/g-C3N4 composite for efficient water splitting in alkaline conditions. A bottom-up self-assembled method was used to develop carbon nanotube (CNT)/g-C3N4 composites with enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 production. The CNT/g-C3N4 composites exhibited improved charge separation and transfer, resulting in a significant enhancement in photocatalytic H2 evolution. These advancements in the development and application of g-C3N4-based composite materials hold promise for clean energy applications, particularly in the field of photocatalysis and water splitting."
"Dual-functionalized mixed Keggin-Lindqvist-type CuICl-Cl-based polyoxometalate-metal-organic frameworks (POMOFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution under visible light. The hybrid surface interaction between CuICl-Cl and the POMOFs enhances the kinetics of hydrogen evolution and regeneration of the oxidized Ru(bpy)32+ complex, which is used as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The synergistic photocatalysis between the two POM types, along with the larger spaces and channels in the POMOFs, further enhances oxygen liberation. This dual-functionalized approach aims to achieve a highly proficient charge transfer mechanism, resulting in improved photocatalytic performance.

Previous research on MOF-based heterojunctions, such as MIL-MIL-NH2 and MIL-MIL-NH2 composites, has demonstrated their characteristic Type II heterojunctions with staggered band gaps. In these heterojunctions, MIL-NH2 plays the role of a photosensitizer, absorbing extended visible spectrum light and causing photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). The electrons are then transferred to the CB of MIL, where they are transported to the exposed photoexcitation region of MIL-NH2 and eventually carried to the CB of HOH-, where they catalyze the kinetics of hydrogen liberation reactions."
"Various photocatalysts have been developed for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation, including TaON, SrNbO2N, transition metal oxides (e.g., BiVO4, AgVO3), metal nitrides and oxynitrides (e.g., GaN, ZnO-GaN solid solutions), and metal sulfides.

TaON can produce H2 from aqueous solutions using methanol as a sacrificial reagent, but cannot oxidize water due to its lower oxidation potential. SrNbO2N exhibits photoactivity under visible light irradiation due to the hybridization of p orbitals of N and O, which lowers the band gap.

Transition metal oxides such as BiVO4 and AgVO3 have been used for photocatalytic water-splitting reactions. BiVO4 has a layered perovskite structure and produces oxygen in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. AgVO3 has a lower band gap due to the hybridization of p orbitals of O and V, making it active under visible light.

Metal nitrides and oxynitrides, such as GaN and ZnO-GaN solid solutions, have also been investigated as photocatalysts. GaN reacts with nitrides or oxynitrides to form solid solutions with band gaps lower than those of the parent compounds. The valence bands of these solid solutions contain electrons in orbitals of Zn and N, resulting in band gap narrowing and visible light activity.

Metal sulfide-based catalysts are also active under visible light due to their small band gaps. However, they can be unstable in oxidation reactions with water, which limits their practical applications."
"Ni-doped MoSe2-Ti3C2Tx (Ni-MoSe2-Ti3C2Tx) nanocomposites exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media. The Ni doping improves the OER activity of MoSe2-Ti3C2Tx, as evidenced by a lower Tafel slope and higher current density. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and atomic modeling reveal the formation of Ni-V-Ru-LDH, which provides an optimized pathway for OER. The Ni-MoSe2-Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite also shows excellent stability during OER. Bifunctional catalysts constructed by hybridizing different components can synergistically enhance water electrolysis efficiency. Carbon-based materials, such as graphene, have been widely used as substrates for electrocatalysts due to their large surface area and high electrical conductivity. Recent research has focused on the development of bifunctional catalysts based on the hybridization of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), graphene, carbon nitride (g-C3N4), MXenes, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These hybrid catalysts exhibit improved activity, stability, and selectivity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER. The combination of different components with tailored electronic structures and abundant active sites enables the optimization of catalytic performance for overall water splitting."
"Carbon-based materials have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This summary focuses on recent advances in the development of two-dimensional vertically aligned carbon nanosheets (VCNSs) as efficient electrocatalysts. VCNSs exhibit unique structural and electronic properties that make them suitable for electrocatalytic applications. Researchers have explored various strategies to synthesize VCNSs, including zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) derivatives, graphene oxide (GO), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These VCNSs have been successfully doped with heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, boron, and phosphorus, to further enhance their electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to gain insights into the reaction mechanisms and active sites of VCNS-based electrocatalysts. The review also discusses the challenges and future directions in the development of VCNS-based electrocatalysts, emphasizing the need for rational design, understanding of structure-activity relationships, and integration with other materials to achieve high-performance and durable electrocatalysts for practical applications in water electrolysis and other electrochemical devices."
"MXenes, particularly Ti-based carbides, have shown promise for water splitting. Theoretical studies predict the potential of Cr-based MXenes for efficient water electrolysis. DFT calculations reveal that the interfacial bonding between Ni and P in Cr-based MXenes is stable, resulting in high current densities and low overpotentials for both OER and HER. The Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism dominates the process, with the transfer of electrons from Ni atoms to the MXene terminal improving bond cooperation and promoting the desorption of intermediate products. Wang et al. designed vertically grown VS nanosheets on VC, which exhibited high activity and stability for seawater electrolysis. The composite material followed the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, with low overpotentials and Tafel slopes. The vertically grown structure inhibited restacking and increased the specific surface area, exposing more active sites. The composite catalyst exhibited long-term stability in natural seawater environments. However, MXene-based catalysts face challenges related to oxidation stability in water splitting applications. Oxidation can occur due to vacancies, defects, and exposure to water, leading to the destruction of the MXene structure and decreased catalytic activity. Industrial-grade water electrolysis requires high current densities, which can exacerbate the stability problems of MXenes in water media."
"The synthesis of MXene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production has been widely explored, with various methods employed to enhance their performance.

"MXenes have demonstrated promising applications in various fields, including photocatalysis, due to their unique properties. Researchers have explored modifications such as doping foreign atoms (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur) and adding cocatalysts (e.g., noble metal nanoparticles) to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Heterojunction formation by combining MXenes with semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO) further improves charge separation and catalytic efficiency. Surface modification enhances MXenes' stability and light-absorbing capabilities. Studies have shown that MXenes can serve as both photocatalysts and cocatalysts in photochemical reactions. Recent achievements include MXene-derived TiO2-MXene and metal-MXene nanocomposites with improved catalytic mechanisms and photoelectrochemical properties. MXene-based photocatalysts have applications in photocatalytic water splitting, degradation of organic pollutants, nitrogen fixation and reduction, CO production, H2O2 fuel production, desulfurization, and denitrogenation. The role of MXenes as cocatalysts in these applications has been extensively discussed.

The use of MXenes as photocatalysts for water treatment has been addressed, emphasizing challenges and growth potential."
"Despite the high cost of synthesis, metal-doped photocatalysts face the issue of photocorrosion. To address this, nonmetal doping using carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen has emerged as a preferred alternative. Nonmetal dopants introduce intermediate energy levels within the band gap of TiO2, reducing its electronegativity and enhancing its catalytic activity. Nitrogen doping is particularly suitable for TiO2 due to the comparable atomic size and stability of nitrogen atoms, which introduces an energy level below the valence band (VB) of TiO2. This energy level acts as a trapping center for photogenerated electrons, reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. Nonmetal elements substituted for oxygen atoms in TiO2 primarily affect the VB, composed primarily of p states. However, nonmetal doping can also alter the conduction band (CB), which is mainly composed of Ti states. Lighter elements such as boron, carbon, and nitrogen substitute oxygen atoms in the VB, depopulating one, two, and three electrons, respectively. These new states are progressively less bound due to the smaller nuclear effective charge. In the case of the heavier dopant fluorine, its p states lie at the bottom of the VB. Since fluorine is monovalent, an extra electron per atom must be transferred to empty Ti states, resulting in a self-trapped dxy state at the bottom of the CB. Boron, carbon, and nitrogen can be doped interstitially into the TiO2 structure, binding to lattice atoms and transferring one electron each according to the redox potential. The band gap structure of substitutional and interstitial C-doped anatase TiO2 has been studied, with implications for the application of C-doped TiO2 as a cocatalyst. Cocatalysts enhance the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions by forming an interface with the semiconductor, promoting electron-hole pair separation, trapping charge carriers, and providing highly active reaction sites for redox reactions. Trapped charges improve photocatalytic reactions by enhancing surface charge separation, acting as factors that enhance photocatalytic selectivity and activity. Furthermore, the application of cocatalysts may increase the stability of photocatalysts by providing alternative reaction sites and suppressing charge carrier accumulation, thereby decreasing photocorrosion. The adsorption and activation performance of reactant molecules on the semiconductor surface are greatly determined by the surface cocatalyst and the location of redox reactions at the semiconductor-cocatalyst interface. Surface modification is a strategy for enhancing photocatalytic selectivity and activity, with nanophotocatalysts being modified to prevent aggregation and increase accessible surface areas. Hierarchical nanopores in TiO2 nanophotocatalysts create hierarchically porous structures with interconnected pore systems and high specific surface areas, accessible pore walls enhance reactant adsorption and light harvesting. Multistage pore structures with different dimensional levels enhance photocatalytic efficiency. Different facets of TiO2 crystals exhibit individual properties, catalytic reactivity, and selectivity due to different optical and electronic structures. Exposing highly reactive facets is a successful strategy for increasing photocatalytic activity in TiO2. Low-index facets exposed on TiO2 crystals have applications in solar energy conversion, photocatalysis, gas sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis. Anatase facets average surface energies based on Wulff construction, with TiO2 anatase crystals dominated by thermodynamically stable, less reactive facets. However, experimental and theoretical studies have shown that anatase photocatalytic activity is higher on higher facets. Interstitially doped anatase TiO2 exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution compared to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles."
"Doping mxenes, two-dimensional materials with unique electronic and structural properties, is an effective method to enhance their catalytic activity. Doping can alter the electronic structure, element composition, and periodic network structure of mxenes, promoting the redistribution of surface charge and changing their spin distribution. This can lower reaction energy barriers and increase the active surface area for electrocatalytic reactions. Both metal and nonmetal atoms have been used as dopants, and two main doping forms exist: non-situ and in-situ strategies. Non-situ doping involves directly using a substance to dope the base material via electrostatic adsorption, while in-situ doping involves directly reacting or growing the dopant on the mxene. Transition metal doping, particularly with elements like Nb, Ni, and Co, can optimize the adsorption of intermediates and electron transfer at the surface of mxenes. Doping with multiple transition metals can create new reaction sites and further improve catalytic activity. The type, content, and coverage of doped transition metals can significantly influence the catalytic performance of mxenes. For example, Ni doping has been shown to improve the hydrogen adsorption and catalytic activity of V-based mxenes. Non-transition metal doping, such as with N and P, can also enhance the catalytic activity of mxenes by modifying their electronic structure and increasing the number of active sites. By adjusting the proportion of doped transition metal atoms, the g-h value of mxenes can be tuned to approach the optimal value for electrocatalytic reactions. Doping transition metals provides electrons that fill antibonding orbitals, leading to hybridization of H orbitals and p-orbitals. This increases the electron density on H orbitals and decreases the interaction strength between H and the original intermediate, thereby weakening the adsorption of H and facilitating the electrocatalytic process. Researchers have also developed novel methods to dope mxenes, such as inserting a Ga layer and then etching it to form doped mxenes. This approach has been used to successfully dope mxenes with transition metals such as Co and Mo, resulting in improved electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reactions. Overall, doping mxenes with various elements and combinations of elements offers a promising strategy to tailor their electronic and structural properties for enhanced electrocatalytic activity in a wide range of applications."
"Environmentally friendly energy fuels, such as hydrogen, are gaining significant attention. Rao et al. reported the fabrication of wide band gap semiconductor-based graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) materials using a thermal pyrolysis method. The resulting g-C3N4 photoelectrode demonstrated the ability to improve the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, facilitating the production of hydrogen fuels via the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting process. Furthermore, different kinds of electrodes based on g-C3N4, layered double hydroxides, nanosheets, graphene oxide, metal chalcogenides, and MXene have been fabricated using diverse techniques. These materials are regarded as highly efficient photoelectrocatalysts, significantly advancing solar energy conversion and photoelectrochemical water-splitting reactions. Yin and coworkers utilized a facile hydrothermal method to create a Janus-structured cobalt-nanoparticle-coupled Ti3C2 MXene quantum dot (CoQD-Ti3C2 MXene) Schottky catalyst. The CoQD-Ti3C2 MXene demonstrated significantly enhanced photocurrent density and carrier migration efficiency, measuring 1.24 mA cm-2 and 0.012 cm2 V-1 s-1, respectively. Another report by Ashraf and coworkers developed a composite material involving polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN) integrated with highly reduced graphene oxide (hGO). Remarkably, the PCN-hGO nanocomposite exhibited a superior photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm-2 compared to pristine PCN (0.7 mA cm-2) under alkaline conditions. Shen and colleagues recently used a cost-effective electrodeposition method to fabricate a Mo-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH)-NiOx/Ni-protected Si photoanode. The incorporation of Mo into the fabrication process notably increased the presence of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, Mo leaching induced dynamic self-reconstruction of the surface conditions, enhancing the PEC oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, as evidenced by an onset potential of 1.2 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a substantial photocurrent density reaching 2.2 mA cm-2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fabrication, properties, design, and synthesis of electrode materials, also outlining potential trends for various types of d-based heterogeneous graphitic carbon nitride, transition metal oxides, perovskites, molybdenum carbide, layered double hydroxides, nanosheets, graphene oxide, transition metal chalcogenides, and MXene photocatalytic materials for PEC water-splitting reactions. Initially, the focus is on exploring the promising characteristics exhibited by various types of d-based electrode materials. Subsequently, the review emphasizes different approaches to modifying these materials to enhance their photoelectrocatalytic activity. Finally, the review addresses the major challenges associated with d-based photocatalysts and explores future research opportunities.

These materials include graphene, graphitic carbon nitride, transition metal oxides, metal nanosheets, hexagonal boron nitride, perovskite, MXene, layered double hydroxides, and metal chalcogenides."
"Understanding the electrocatalytic reactivity of MXene-based catalytic materials is crucial for predicting and discovering highly active materials. DFT calculation models based on defect MXenes can provide insights into the catalytic mechanisms of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. However, real-time reaction conditions need to be explored systematically using in situ operational characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and XAFS. These techniques can monitor the structure, oxidation state, coordination environment, and electronic properties of MXene materials and interactions with active sites, providing real-time feedback on the catalytic process and a better understanding of the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that operating conditions need to be reasonably controlled to minimize the influence of in situ technology on the MXene material. For example, high-energy X-ray XAS can cause surface oxidation of MXene. Additionally, the influence of electrostatic potential and solvation on the catalytic mechanism needs to be considered, especially for operation technologies based on site monitoring. Current research on MXene-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting mainly focuses on composition optimization, alloying, morphology control, structure regulation, and electronic structure control of composite materials. However, there is limited research on optimization strategies based on the influence of the double layer-water interface on the surface performance of the catalyst. Transfer ions at the interface provide a new direction for performance optimization. In summary, while current research is still based on several major MXene materials, there is an urgent need to expand research to other types of MXenes to change the situation of limited nitride MXenes research. This will provide theoretical guidance for the development of novel and efficient MXene-based catalysts. It is also important to highlight the importance of breaking traditional thinking and daring to think differently. MXene-based materials have excellent performances that can be utilized for water electrolysis, driving innovative thinking and creating the possibility of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency, and high-stability water electrolysis for hydrogen production."
"Doping late transition metal mxenes can significantly enhance their electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Anand et al. used first-principles calculations and machine learning descriptors to study the effect of doping on the HER activity of mxenes. They found that the original undoped mxenes exhibited poor HER catalytic activity. By doping mxenes with different combinations of transition metals, they identified that Ni-doped Nb2CO2 and Sc-doped Nb2CO2 possess excellent HER bifunctional catalytic activity and stability. The HER mechanism on mxenes follows either the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) or the Langmuir-Ogura mechanism (LOM), depending on the adsorption free energy of the intermediates. Doping mxenes with Ni and Co increases the p-band electrons, activating the LOM pathway. In addition to acidic electrolytes, research on HER in alkaline conditions is also important. Du et al. doped a Ti layer in Ti3C2Tx with Nb and modified it with a NiCo alloy to synthesize a series of nano-hybrids for alkaline electrocatalytic HER in KOH. Among the nano-hybrids, NiCoTi2Nb0.25C2Tx exhibited excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential and high current density. Doping with transition metals can modify the d-band electrons and move the Fermi level, improving the electronic conductivity and catalytic activity. Nonmetallic doping can also enhance the catalytic activity of mxenes. Nonmetals with low electronegativity can effectively change the adsorption strength of surface reaction intermediates and improve the conductivity of mxenes. However, the position of nonmetal doping and the presence of functional groups can affect the surface active sites of mxenes. To obtain mxenes with fewer layers and higher specific surface area, organic intercalation agents are often used. However, these agents may affect the surface active sites of mxenes. Therefore, the synthesis process and doping strategy need to be carefully controlled to maximize the catalytic activity of mxenes."
"Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with its layered structure and properties similar to graphite, has attracted interest for electrocatalytic applications. The incorporation of hBN into composite catalysts has been shown to enhance their performance, particularly for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). hBN-based heterojunction electrocatalysts have also found wide applications in electrochemical energy storage and sensing. Perovskite-based electrode materials have gained attention due to their cost-effectiveness, versatile structures, and inherent oxygen vacancy content.

"The use of monolayer cocatalysts on TiC-MXene (TiC-TX) surfaces has been found to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production. The monolayer cocatalysts expose more active sites and provide a larger specific surface area (SSA) for photocatalytic reactions compared to multilayer cocatalysts. Additionally, the shorter distance for migration of photogenerated charges in monolayer cocatalysts makes them more effective in separating photogenerated holes and electrons. In contrast to monolayer sulfides, the hydrophilic functionalities on TiC-TX (TiC-TX-F-OH) encourage significant interactions with water molecules. Furthermore, the exposure of metal terminal sites on TiC-TX may increase redox reactivity. Su et al. reported the production of TiC-TX monolayer and multilayer cocatalysts for application with commercial TiO2-P. The monolayer TiC-TX's ultrathin nature and high electronic conductivity facilitate efficient electron migration from TiO2 to TiC-TX, resulting in greater photocatalytic hydrogen production and electron-hole pair separation efficiency. The TiC-TX multilayer cocatalyst in TiC-TX/TiO composites exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen production greater than pure TiO2. Among different ChlNTi-CTX composites, the ChlNTi-CTX sample with 1 wt% TiC-TX generates the highest hydrogen production rate, which is 1.5 mmol h-1 g-1, greater than pure TiO2 (0.3 mmol h-1 g-1). These results indicate that monolayer TiC-TX is a better cocatalyst for charge separation in TiO2 than multilayer TiC-TX. An in-situ method was used to manufacture TiC MXene embedded TiO2 nanosheets (M-TiO). The peculiar hierarchical TiC MXene/TiO/ZnIn2S4 (M-TiO/ZIS) photocatalyst created efficient hydrogen transfer channels, resulting in a high hydrogen production rate. The hybridized photocatalyst with an optimized ZIS quantity exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 1.4 mmol g-1 h-1, which is higher than pure ZIS (0.6 mmol g-1 h-1). The M-TiO/ZIS composite showed excellent light harvesting due to the ZIS, ample active sites, and effective separation of photogenerated charges at the heterojunction interface. Recently, a hydrothermal technique was used to fabricate ZnCdS/TiO2-Na-MXene composites. The retardation of additional oxidation of TiC MXene by TiO2 usage increased the efficiency of the MXene composite materials. The increased MB undergoes photocatalytic degradation using ZnCdS/TiO2-Na-MXene composites. The great adsorption ability of MB on MXene could enhance degradation efficiency considerably. The higher MXene content improved photocatalytic reduction activity. N-doped MXene boosted even the optimal hydrogen production efficiency (1.2 mmol g-1 h-1), which is several-fold higher compared to ZnCdS nanoparticles. In summary, MXenes have garnered widespread interest in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis due to their intrinsic benefits, including high hydrophilicity, metallic conductivity, large surface area, and rich surface functionalities. This paper summarizes MXenes' fundamental properties, synthesis techniques, virgin MXene composites, and current advances, challenges, and application prospects in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis."

The S-scheme mechanism involves the spatial separation of electrons and holes onto different materials, significantly reducing the recombination rate. The conductive nature of MXenes facilitates the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

"Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for hydrogen production due to its utilization of solar energy and abundance of water resources. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a widely investigated semiconductor for photocatalytic hydrogen production due to its nontoxicity, photochemical stability, and low cost. However, its wide band gap limits light harvesting and high recombination rate reduces photocatalytic activity. Coupling TiO2 with semiconductors with narrow band gaps and high charge separation efficiency has been applied to enhance photocatalytic activity. Graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) is a metal-free semiconductor with a low band gap that is active in the visible region. It is chemically and thermally stable and can be synthesized from cheap precursors. However, the overall water splitting efficiency of gCN is limited by the low migration rate of photogenerated charge carriers to the surface reaction sites and the possibility of backward electron transfer. Recent review papers have discussed different methods for photocatalytic hydrogen production and factors affecting photocatalytic performance."
"The surface facets of TiO2 nanoparticles can significantly influence their photocatalytic activity. Anatase TiO2 with higher surface energy facets exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance under UV irradiation. DFT calculations have shown that the (001) facet stabilizes adsorbed water molecules strongly, leading to the stable trapping of photogenerated holes on the bare hydroxylated surface.

The equilibrium shape of anatase and rutile TiO2 crystals, as predicted by the Wulff construction, reveals that the (101) facet has a lower surface energy than the (001) facet. However, both facets coexist in the equilibrium shape of anatase. This indicates that the surface properties and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 particles are strongly dependent on the exposed crystal facets.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the surface facets of TiO2 nanocrystals can be controlled by adjusting the atomic configuration and coordination of the surface atoms. For example, a higher fraction of undercoordinated atoms on the (001) facet results in higher photocatalytic activity.

Inorganic adsorbates, such as sulfate, phosphate, and fluoride ions, can affect the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 by altering its surface functional groups, surface charge, and surface acidity. These inorganic anions may also undergo direct photocatalytic reactions on the illuminated semiconductor surface.

Sensitization of TiO2 with molecular dyes is a strategy to overcome its high bandgap and extend its light absorption to the visible region of the spectrum. Photoexcited electrons from the dye are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, while the oxidized dye is regenerated by a suitable electron donor.

Dye-sensitized TiO2 has been used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and water splitting. The functional groups of the dye and the anchoring of the dye to the TiO2 surface play important roles in the successful sensitization process.

Several dyes, including organic dyes, porphyrins, and ruthenium bipyridyl derivatives, have been used for sensitization of TiO2. Since TiO2 has a wide bandgap, it cannot absorb the near-infrared (NIR) part of the solar spectrum. NIR photocatalysts, such as CuO-HPO4 and BiWO6, are being studied to utilize a larger portion of the solar spectrum."

"MXene-based catalysts have shown promise for water splitting, but their performance can be further enhanced by combining different catalysts. Wet impregnation methods have been used to create composites of MXenes with transition metals, such as Pt and Ti, to form disordered alloys or ordered intermetallic phases (IMCs). The formation of IMCs can extend the edge crystal forms, creating more active sites for the electrocatalytic process. DFT analysis has shown that the d-band center of Pt in Pt-Ti IMC and Pt-Nb IMC is shifted, reducing the energy barrier for surface adsorption reactions and enhancing the DOS strength. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to study the formation of Pt-Ti IMC on Ti3C2Tx, revealing the importance of annealing temperature in controlling the degree of transition from single atoms to IMCs. The best catalytic performance for HER was obtained in acidic conditions (1 M HClO4), with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and an overpotential of 120 mV at a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1. Quantum dots (QDs) are another type of inorganic nanomaterial with high specific surface area and abundant active sites. Combining MXenes with QDs can avoid the decrease in conductivity caused by self-stacking of MXene interlayers and limit the aggregation of QDs. Pang et al. realized the growth of sub-nanometer Pt QDs on one-dimensional Nb2CTx nanowires at low temperature (200 °C) without a reducing atmosphere. This composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in both acidic and alkaline conditions, with current densities reaching 10 mA cm-2 and overpotentials of 110 mV and 120 mV, respectively.
