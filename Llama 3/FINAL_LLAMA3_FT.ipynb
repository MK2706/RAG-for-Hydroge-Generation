      " Using a Ni foam (NF) substrate for the Ni/Mo-TEC@NF complex offers several advantages: High electrical conductivity: NF is a highly conductive substrate, which facilitates efficient charge transfer and minimizes ohmic losses during electrochemical reactions. Large surface area: The porous structure of NF provides a large surface area for the deposition of Ni/Mo-TEC, maximizing the number of active sites available for electrocatalysis. Mechanical stability: NF is a durable and robust substrate that can withstand the harsh conditions of electrochemical reactions, ensuring the long-term stability of the Ni/Mo-TEC@NF complex. Cost-effectiveness: NF is a relatively inexpensive material, making it a cost-effective choice for large-scale applications. Versatility: NF can be easily integrated into various electrochemical devices, such as flow cells, electrolyzers, and batteries, enabling its use in a wide range of electrocatalytic applications.Overall, the combination of high electrical conductivity, large surface area, mechanical stability, cost-effectiveness, and versatility makes Ni foam a suitable substrate for the Ni/Mo-TEC@NF complex, enhancing its electrocatalytic performance and practical applications.\n"

      "The performance of LSC-based photocatalytic devices can be further improved through optimization of the LSC material, photocatalyst, and device architecture. For instance, improving the antireflective properties of the LSC material can enhance light absorption, while optimizing the thickness and morphology of the photocatalyst layer can enhance light harvesting and charge separation. Additionally, integrating the LSC material and photocatalyst into a tandem or multi-junction device can significantly improve overall performance. By optimizing these factors, LSC-based photocatalytic devices can achieve higher efficiency and scalability for practical applications in hydrogen production and other related fields.\n"
